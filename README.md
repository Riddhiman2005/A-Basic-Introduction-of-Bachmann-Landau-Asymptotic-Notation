# A Basic Introduction of Bachmann-Landau AsymptoticNotation


Paul Bachmann introduced the $O$ notation in his book *Die Analytische Zahlentheorie*
while working on **asymptotic estimates and handling error terms in analytic number theory**. 
His ideas served as inspiration for Edmund Landau, who further refined the concept and introduced a stronger variant 
known as the little $o$ notation in his book *Handbuch der Lehre von der Verteilung der Primzahlen*. These notations are now 
extensively used in the field of analytic number theory.

Although mathematicians generally grasp the meaning of big $O$ and little $o$ notation intuitively, effectively 
communicating their precise definitions can sometimes pose challenges. Therefore, this paper aims to thoroughly comprehend the essence of big $O$ and 
little $o$ notation and elucidate how to appropriately apply them in various mathematical contexts.
